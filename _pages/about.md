I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/group/biostatistics-multiscale-systems" target="_blank">Biostatistics and Biomedical Informatics Group</a>, led by <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/heidi-hanson" target="_blank">Dr. Heidi Hanson</a>. My work involves developing statistical methods to support biomedical research, harnessing the power of high-performance computing to solve real-world problems.

I obtained my PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/" target="_blank">Dr. Jon Wakefield</a>. My dissertation was *Methods and Software for Small Area Estimation in Low- and Middle-Income Countries*. As part of this work, the <a href="https://sae4health.stat.uw.edu/" target="_blank">SAE4Health</a> initiative has been adopted at <a href="https://sae4health.stat.uw.edu/impact/WHO_workshop_series/" target="_blank">WHO techinical workshops</a> to support health resource planning in low- and middle-income countries. 

Before my PhD, I studied Biostatistics as an undergraduate at UNC-Chapel Hill, advised by <a href="https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/feng-chang-lin-phd/" target="_blank">Dr. Feng-Chang Lin</a>.


My research interests include small area estimation, environmental health, survival analysis, survey methods, and machine learning.

I develop statistical and computational tools to support biomedical research and population health,  harnessing the power of high-performance computing to solve real-world problems. 

I obtained my PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/" target="_blank">Dr. Jon Wakefield</a>. My dissertation, *Methods and Software for Small Area Estimation in Low- and Middle-Income Countries*, integrated design-based inference from survey sampling with Bayesian smoothing, leading to new methods for estimating key health indicators, and algorithms for producing urban/rural classifications for countries. To make these tools more accessible and impactful, I led the development for the sae4health R Shiny app and contrtibued to the <a href="https://sae4health.stat.uw.edu/" target="_blank">SAE4Health</a> initiative, which has been adopted at <a href="https://sae4health.stat.uw.edu/impact/WHO_workshop_series/" target="_blank">WHO techinical workshops</a> to support health resource planning in low- and middle-income countries. -->
